## Attributes

Attributes will likely be the most loved and valuable feature to both Operators and management. Streamlyne intends to provide a layer on top of existing DCS and Operator added metrics and allow for quickly looking over Trends. Streamlyne Analytics will then take this same data and provide predictions for preventative maintenance, however that is a feature for another day.

We have two designs for you to choose from:
