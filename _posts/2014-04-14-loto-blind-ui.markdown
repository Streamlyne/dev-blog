## LOTO & Blind
We have built out the LOTO and Blind system for Assets.

### Screenshot 4: View Isolation Point
Some of our Users were concerned that they *must* input data into the fields. However, they only had to edit the fields if they intended / wanted to edit them. To avoid confusion, we now have an Edit mode toggle: you initially view the Isolation Point without the ability to edit, and if you intend to edit an Isolation Point you simply click “Edit” to toggle into Edit mode.

### Screenshot 5: Edit Isolation Point
This is what editing mode looks like. Click “Cancel” to revert changes and exit editing model, or “Save” to save your changes.
