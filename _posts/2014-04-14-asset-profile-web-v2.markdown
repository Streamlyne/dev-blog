# Asset Profile Redesigned - Web Dashboard

We received a lot of very useful feedback in Dawson's trip to the Nevis plant.
I'd like to thank all of the Operators for sharing their knowledge and patients.

## Asset Profile Layout
After receiving feedback from Operators we have changed the layout of the Asset Profile. We are now including a list of tabs for active Assets, and a left side navigation bar for listing all of the Asset views.
