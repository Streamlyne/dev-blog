# Asset Profile Redesigned - Web Dashboard

We received a lot of very useful feedback in Dawson's trip to the Nevis plant.
I'd like to thank all of the Operators for sharing their knowledge and patients.

## Asset Profile Layout
After receiving feedback from Operators we have changed the layout of the Asset Profile. We are now including a list of tabs for active Assets, and a left side navigation bar for listing all of the Asset views.

## Timeline
We know that there is a lot of effort towards being up-to-date with the ongoings at the plant and recent events. We intend to allow viewing chronological events throughout a plant quick and easy. Our current concept is the Asset Timeline.

### Questions
We would like to know:
- What Events should be recorded in the Timeline?
- Are their any events that Streamlyne count automatically create that would be beneficial for Operators? Such as created new Work Orders?
- Would being able to “post” Events be valuable to Operators? For instance, you are walking around the plant and inspect an Asset and notice a visual abnormality and wish to make a post to see if there
- If Yes, would you like to attach pictures to a Timeline Event?
- Would adding comments to a Timeline Event be valuable? An Operator could comment on a Timeline event and start a productive discussion.


## LOTO & Blind
We have built out the LOTO and Blind system for Assets.

### Screenshot 4: View Isolation Point
Some of our Users were concerned that they *must* input data into the fields. However, they only had to edit the fields if they intended / wanted to edit them. To avoid confusion, we now have an Edit mode toggle: you initially view the Isolation Point without the ability to edit, and if you intend to edit an Isolation Point you simply click “Edit” to toggle into Edit mode.

### Screenshot 5: Edit Isolation Point
This is what editing mode looks like. Click “Cancel” to revert changes and exit editing model, or “Save” to save your changes.

### Questions


## Work Orders
We are working on Work Orders and Asset Management integrations. This is a lengthy process.
We do not intend to replicate functionality of Asset Management systems, such as Maximo, only compliment and provide a read-only mobile and user friendly component to an otherwise daunting piece of software.

## Attributes

Attributes will likely be the most loved and valuable feature to both Operators and management. Streamlyne intends to provide a layer on top of existing DCS and Operator added metrics and allow for quickly looking over Trends. Streamlyne Analytics will then take this same data and provide predictions for preventative maintenance, however that is a feature for another day.

We have two designs for you to choose from:

## Documents

Asset Documents is a feature we had wanted to include since the beginning of Streamlyne, however, we initially focused on other features. Now that we have settled on our other Asset-centric features, we want to develop the Documents feature. In our terminology, Asset Documents are any files that can be attached to an Asset, including but not limited to Manuals, Procedures, Pictures, and CAD files.
