  An overview of our intent with our new development blog. A brief highlight of
  of our timeline. How to give us feedback.

Our development blog platform has been created with the intent of keeping our
investors, operators, and people of interest up-to-date with our progress. The
goal is to involve you in development of the Streamlyne platform so that way we
may regularly receive feedback and validation.

You may view the current state of the web dashboard
<a href="http://107.170.91.36/dashboard/#/assets/search" target="_blank">here
</a>. This is a work in progress and purposefully lacks data and functionality.

### The Plan

The server component (the engine to support all of the functionality) of
Streamlyne is complete and ready to go. All we need to do is connect it to the
user interface (the
<a href="http://107.170.91.36/dashboard/#/assets/search" target="_blank">web
application</a>). Before we do this we are looking for more feedback on how we
should structure the application. We want to validate our application against
you prior to coupling these pieces together that way we may ensure the end
product will make life easier for operators, and thus engrained in their daily
workflow.  

We will be releasing at least one more blog post this week detailing the
restructuring of the application we have done over March. Moving forward we
will be **releasing at least one development update per week**.

### Timeline

Our focus for April is nailing down and releasing our mobile and web platform.
If you look through the
<a href="http://107.170.91.36/dashboard/#/assets/search" target="_blank">web
application</a> you will notice the following features.

- LOTO & Blinds
- Metrics
- Comments
- Timeline

After implementing this functionality we will be moving onto the meat and
potatoes, DCS! We are in the process of gaining read access to the Nevis DCS
system and have been developing out our analytics platform. Moving forward
we may then begin pattern mining DCS data in correlation with asset knowledge
built by operators through there daily use of the Streamlyne platform in
efforts to predict asset failures.
