## Documents

Asset Documents is a feature we had wanted to include since the beginning of Streamlyne, however, we initially focused on other features. Now that we have settled on our other Asset-centric features, we want to develop the Documents feature. In our terminology, Asset Documents are any files that can be attached to an Asset, including but not limited to Manuals, Procedures, Pictures, and CAD files.
