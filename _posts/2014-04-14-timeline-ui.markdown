## Timeline
We know that there is a lot of effort towards being up-to-date with the ongoings at the plant and recent events. We intend to allow viewing chronological events throughout a plant quick and easy. Our current concept is the Asset Timeline.

### Questions
We would like to know:

- What Events should be recorded in the Timeline?

- Are their any events that Streamlyne count automatically create that would be beneficial for Operators? Such as created new Work Orders?

- Would being able to “post” Events be valuable to Operators? For instance, you are walking around the plant and inspect an Asset and notice a visual abnormality and wish to make a post to see if there

- If Yes, would you like to attach pictures to a Timeline Event?

- Would adding comments to a Timeline Event be valuable? An Operator could comment on a Timeline event and start a productive discussion.
